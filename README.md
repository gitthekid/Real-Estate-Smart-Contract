# Real-Estate-Smart-Contract
This project could be used in the infrastructure of a Real Estate DAPP, to NFT-ify a real estate property, reducing the number of middle parties involved in a real estate sale and simplifying the Real Estate sale process. This project was developed using a tutorial as a methodology to teach me for complex implementations of Solidity.
This project has has two contracts, the Real Estate Contract and the Escrow contract. The Real Estate Contract represents ownership of the property. The Escrow contract is the methodology by which a property can be transferred, including a the verifying of 3rd party inspector, down payments by the buyer, connectivity of a lender, and approval by all parties before a final sale goes through.
